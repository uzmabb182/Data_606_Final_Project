# Data Preparation

```{r }
# load dataset1
metadata_df <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfpoulos/pymaceuticals/master/data/Mouse_metadata.csv", header=T, sep=",")
metadata_df
```

```{r}
# return a list
metadata_df %>%
  group_by(Drug.Regimen) 
```

```{r}
# load dataset2
results_df <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfpoulos/pymaceuticals/master/data/Study_results.csv", header=T, sep=",")
results_df
```

# Research question 
*** You should phrase your research question in a way that matches up with the scope of inference your dataset allows for.
```{r}
### In this study, 249 mice identified with Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumor growth, kind of skin cancer,  
### were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.
### The objective is to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens 
### and find out which treatment is most effective.
### Null Hyothesis: There is no difference on the results of drug treatment regimens.
### Alternate Hyothesis: Capomulin does impact the results and is effective in the treatment of SCC tumor growth.
```

# Cases
*** What are the cases, and how many are there?
```{r}
### There are 249 unique mouse id and so are the number of cases that treated with variety if drug regimem.
### Therefore there are 249 row count in the metadata_df
### The results_df dataset holds the tumor growth measurments observed for each Mouse ID and carries 1,893 rows results.
```

# Data collection
*** Describe the method of data collection.
```{r}
### Data must be collected by the Pymaceutical company. But I do not have the source of the data.
```

# Type of study
*** What type of study is this (observational/experiment)?
```{r}
### This is a experimental study.
```

# Data Source
***If you collected the data, state self-collected. If not, provide a citation/link.
```{r}
### Data is collected from GitHub Repsitory from the following links:
### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfpoulos/pymaceuticals/master/data/Mouse_metadata.csv
### https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfpoulos/pymaceuticals/master/data/Study_results.csv
```
# Response
*** What is the response variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?
```{r}
### The response variable is the size of tumor, "Tumor.Volume..mm3." and it holds a numerical data.
```
# Explanatory
*** What is the explanatory variable, and what type is it (numerical/categorical)?
```{r}
### The explanatory variable is the "Drug.Regimen" and it holds a categorical data and "Timepoint" which holds numerical data
```
#Relevant summary statistics
*** Provide summary statistics relevant to your research question. For example, 
**** if youâ€™re comparing means across groups provide means, SDs, sample sizes of each group. 
*** This step requires the use of R, hence a code chunk is provided below. Insert more code chunks as needed.
